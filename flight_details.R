#'It will summarise flights by distance travelled, altitude, speed etc.
#'They will also be labelled by foraging trip and device_info_serial.
#'The flights should be numbered for each foraging trip. Perhaps also labelling the first and final flight of a foraging trip - which may contitute 'commuting' flight.
