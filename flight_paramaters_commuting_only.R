# A script to analyse each flight, with various
# paramaters, such as maximum altitude, calculated.
# First the database will be queried to pull out
# the data we need for our analysis.
# Second. Various paramaters and information about
# the flights will be calculated.
# Third. This will be ouput to a new database table
# specifically for flights.


# Database functions   ------
# To link to database
library(RODBC)

# Establish a connection to the database
gps.db <- odbcConnectAccess2007('D:/Documents/Work/GPS_DB/GPS_db.accdb')

# See what tables are available
# sqlTables(gps.db)


# Get commuting flights table
flights.com <- sqlQuery(gps.db, query=
                       "SELECT DISTINCT f.*
  FROM lund_flights_commuting AS f
  ORDER BY f.flight_id ASC;")






# Get a vector of flight numbers -----
flight_id <- sort(unique(flights.com$flight_id))
f <- length(flight_id)


#Run function 'flight.info' in parallel########
require(foreach)
require(doParallel)

#use x cores, general solution for any windows machine.
cl <- makeCluster(parallel::detectCores())     

#start the parellel session of R; the 'slaves', which will run the analysis.
registerDoParallel(cl)   

#this maybe neccessary so that the clustered instances or R have the
#required vairables/ functions in their scope, i.e. those functions
#and vairables which are referred to within the 'foreach' function.
clusterExport(cl, c("flight_id"))   

#NB see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9404881/writing-to-global-variables-in-using-dosnow-and-doing-parallelization-in-r
#There a solution is offered for exporting vairables from foreach to the global environment.

#make a list object to recieve the data
lst <- list()

# flight.info(flights.com$flight_id[5], type = "com")

#get paramaters for each flight
#Use system.time to time how long this takes.

 system.time({lst <- foreach(i = c(1,5,7)) %dopar%{

  #which we wish to run for each device.

#   i <- 3
  x <- flight.info(flight_id[i], type = "com")
  x <- t(x)
  
  #output data as list (this will be appended to the global list, lst.
  list(x)   
} #end of foreach functions
}) #end of things being timed by system.time
