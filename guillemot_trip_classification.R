# Classification of guillemot GPS data into foraging trips
# Will base this largely on the script used to do this for the LBBG data,
# adapting slightly the various thresholds etc.
# Purpose of this script is simply to identify foraging trips,
# Then get start-time, end-time, and number each trip with unique ID
# Summary statistics for each foraging trip will be extracted in a
# second sepperate script.


# DB function to extract data for each device_ID/ ring number? for deployment
# period.

# Will need to do sepprately for the IGU and UvA devices


# Make some calculations on GPS data
# - distance from colony

# Classify into foraging trips (see previous
# analysis for the LBBG)

# Assemble table of foraging trips
# - trip_id
# - start_time
# - end_time
# - device_id


# Output details to DB
