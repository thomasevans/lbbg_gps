# For 2009 and 2014 guillemot GPS data produce
# raster layers for area use weighted by time in
# raster tile.
# Then calculate difference between the two rasters
# to show how area use differs between the two years.
# Plot all this and save to a PDF file.



# Load bathymetric data


# Load 2014 data

# Load 2013 data (maybe make new 'temp' table
# in DB first)

# Filter GPS data by quality criteria + distance
# from colony

# Produce raster layers for both years using
# points in raster thing

# Make a difference raster, by subtracting one
# from the other


# Plot all of the above on a map
