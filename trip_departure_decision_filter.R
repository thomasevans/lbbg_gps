# This is script is to filter the trip_departure_decision
# data to retain only relevant trips. For example it will
# only include trips of a minimum time duration and distance
# plus will exclude trips of too great a time duration.
# Further it filters by periods, so we only retain data
# for relevant months to our analysis (May, June, July),
# months during the core breeding season.
